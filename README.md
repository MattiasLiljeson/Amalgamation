## Overview
Amalgamation is a multiplayer spaceship shooter where a group of 2-8 players battle each other in asteroid cavern networks, randomly generated from various hand crafted chambers and tunnels, in rounds of roughly 10 minutes.
The game is set inside an asteroid, in an old forsaken colony. The various caverns of the asteroid, laid out in a network like structure, each hold their own unique story and culture which influence their design and atmosphere; from moody prison dungeons to weird alien ruins. The design of the machines and structures that inhabits this world are heavily inspired by the dieselpunk genre, art deco design style, various classic sci-fi elements and something that just might be a hint of surrealism.

Our goal with this game is to create something unique that mixes competition with creativity.

##Build
Each spaceship sports a series of connection points and can be built upon using special modules that can be found throughout the world, or shot off and stolen from other players. Each module grants some kind of feature to the ship, whether it be greater firepower, boost in defense or speed or extra connection points for further expansion.

##Steal
The players can use weapon modules to shoot away modules from other playersâ€™ ships and steal them, thus robbing them of not only the module and its features, but also some of the score it would have given to the player at the end of the game. These desirable ship modules will also spawn all around the level, giving rise to action filled dog fights.

##Hoard
Victory during a round can be asserted by collecting and using as many modules as possible and preventing your opponents from doing the same. The player with the most modules collected at the end, most opponents shot and/or with the most modules used throughout the entire round wins the game.
